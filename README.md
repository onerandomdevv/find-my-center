# FindMyCenter 📍

**FindMyCenter** is a mission-critical web application that helps Nigerian students reliably locate their official JAMB exam centres — even on slow networks or when maps are unavailable.

> **Mission:** No student should miss their exam because they couldn’t find the venue.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **Text-First, Offline-Friendly**
  Designed to work on slow 3G networks. Maps are an enhancement, not a dependency.

- 🛡️ **Clean & Verified Data**
  890+ exam centres cleaned, normalized, and structured for accuracy and consistency.

- 🔍 **Deterministic Search Flow**
  Users filter by **State → LGA → Centre** to avoid ambiguity and similar place names.

- 🗺️ **Optional Map View**
  Embedded map view for visual context, without forcing external navigation apps.

- 🚀 **Instant Load (SSG)**
  Pages are statically generated for near-zero load time and high reliability.

## 📊 Data Coverage & Audit

The project includes tooling to ensure high data availability across Nigeria.

### Running the Data Audit

To verify coverage against official LGA requirements:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/data-audit.ts
```

This script identifies:

- Missing LGAs (Zero coverage)
- Low-coverage states (< 50%)
- Data gaps in high-population areas (Lagos, FCT, etc.)
